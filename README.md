## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am NicolÃ¡s!


I'm NicolÃ¡s Bruno, an Electronics Engineer turned Software Engineer mainly focused on backend development.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked across a variety of industries from IoT and utilities to event management, marketing, and telemedicine and contributed to both small startups and large-scale organizations. While my core strength lies in backend development using **Python** (FastAPI, Django) and **Ruby on Rails**, Iâ€™ve also worked on infrastructure, frontend features using **React**, and backend tasks for data processing and push notification delivery, including integration with OLAP systems.

I enjoy solving real-world problems with clean, scalable, and well-tested code, and Iâ€™m particularly motivated by deep technical challenges, thoughtful architecture, and meaningful impact.
